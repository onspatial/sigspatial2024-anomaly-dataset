# Patterns-of-Life Simulation

This is a clone of the Patterns-of-Life simulation project. The original project is located at the master branch of [https://github.com/gmuggs/pol](https://github.com/gmuggs/pol). I develope new features and customize the simulation based on my research needs here.

Dataset: [OSF](https://osf.io/dg6t3/)
