# Patterns-of-Life Simulation

This is a clone of the Patterns-of-Life simulation project. The original project is located at the master branch of [https://github.com/gmuggs/pol](https://github.com/gmuggs/pol). I develope new features and customize the simulation based on my research needs here.

# Quick Start

Compile, run, and evaluate the simulation in one command:

```
bash sh.run.sh
```


## How to compile and build a jar file
For the first time to install the dependencies, run the following command:
```
bash sh.mvn.sh full
```
Later, you can run the following command to build a jar file:
```
bash sh.mvn.sh
```

## How to run a simulation

```
cd life
bash sh.live.sh
```
